# videogamelibrary

Welcome to the video game library CSUN-COMP586 repository.

The purpose of this project is to learn the processes, patterns, and
school of thought into creating an application using MVC architecture.

Requirements:
  1.  SPA
  2.  MVC
  3.  ORM
  4.  DI
  5.  Auth

To launch the application locally:
  1.  PostGreSQL 9.5.14
    1.  Create a database called 'vglib'
    2.  Create a user called 'vglibdev'
    3.  Create a password for user called 'abc123vglib'
    4.  Grant all priveleges to user
  2.  Go version go1.10.3    
    1.  Uncomment 'database.MigrateDependencyTables()' and 'database.MigrateTables()'
    2.  Only run this once and check database for the tables.

This will be updated as I continue to work on the application.
